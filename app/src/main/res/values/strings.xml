    <string name="aboutText">Why PSB Routine App?\n\nAlthough we have a PDF routine, using an app provides several advantages. With varying class schedules every day, it becomes necessary to check the routine regularly. However, the PDF routine, containing schedules for three semesters in a table layout, can be tedious and uninspiring. This is where the PSB Routine app comes in, offering a visually distinct semester schedule, making it easy to locate one\'s own schedule. By doing so, the app saves valuable time while providing a premium user experience.</string>
